Yes, being not so sound in technical ground most people choose this \"Networking Device\" i.e., \"Router\" without comparing its compatibility with requirement. Just for simple understanding keep note that \"Router\" is a networking device that forwards data packets between computer networks, also it is invented by William Yeager who founded the \"Cisco\" company. At starting devices are connected through wire to router and router is connected to networking cable which carries the internet, it was like physical wire must be needed to connect with internet. Later technology updated and \"WiFi\" routers are made to connect devices with internet but without any physical wire and may be thats why it is called \"Wireless Fidelity\". The main topic still needs to cover and that is \"What WiFi router one should buy and \"How they can graph Requirement vs Compatibility of WiFi\". According to version Wifi routers are of three types. Wireless AC routers are 3x faster than Wireless N and Wireless N routers are 14x faster than Wireless G. According to bandwidth, mainly recognized routers are of two types Single bandwidth and Dual bandwidth but there is Tri-bandwidth router and Multi-MMO router also available in market. Single band routers are divided as 150 & 300 which are maximum link speeds one modem can offer, operates in 2.4 GHz only and therefore cannot offer a downloading speed greater than 54Mbps. So even having a 100Mbps plan from internet operator like Tikona, user cannot get more than 50Mbps downloading speed. Dual band routers are divided into 600, 750, 900 which are maximum link speeds one modem can offer, operates in 5.1 GHz and therefore cannot offer a downloading speed greater than 2Gbps. Dual band router can create two different wireless networks in the same house. One wireless network will operate in a 2.4 GHz bandwidth (speed as Single band 300) and second wireless network operates in a 5.1 GHz bandwidth (speed of 750 Mbps). With Tri-bandwidth routers itâ€™s simply adding another band, specifically another 5.1 GHz band. MU-MIMO router allows multiple devices to get high-bandwidth Wi-Fi signal at the same time, distributing data more efficiently and giving the fastest Wi-Fi speeds. As per general talking if user, at maximum time do surfing and not more than 3 devices are connected while area which WiFi router need to cover is around 2BHK or 1150 Sqfeet than Single bandwidth router is good option. Also, if demand is of higher speed and two different networks need to be get implemented within area 3BHK or 1600 Sqfeet than Dual bandwidth router must get installed. For multiple device plugin at single time while online gaming is also need to be done without fluctuation in speed than user need to go ahead with Tri-bandwidth of MU-MIMO routers. For office connectivity and data protection surfing it is requested to kindly first consult with Networking engineer and then bought the recommended business router.
