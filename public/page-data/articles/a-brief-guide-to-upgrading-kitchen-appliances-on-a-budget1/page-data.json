These items are home staples that will be used on a regular basis. Fortunately, there are lots of shapes, sizes, and designs of appliances to suit any household requirements. So, even if you’re on a restricted budget, there are lots of options to choose from. Here we’ll explore this in more detail to help you to make your final purchase decision.","content":"Upgrade or Repair?\n\nIf you’re on a limited budget, the first thing you need to consider is whether you upgrade or repair your existing appliances. If you’re remodeling your kitchen, there is a temptation to buy all new appliances, but this can significantly increase the costs. In many cases, an appliance upgrade may not be necessary.\n\nEven if your appliances are looking a little tired, it is possible to hide them behind cabinet fronts if they are still working well. On the other hand, if your appliances are subject to break down issues or are costing you increasing amounts on your energy bills, an upgrade is likely to be the best choice.\n\nFortunately, there are some great ideas to save money when you upgrade your appliances.\n\nBundle Deals\n\nIf you need more than one appliance, you can save money by bundling your appliances into a deal. Consider what appliances you need and what you may need to replace in the near future, so you can maximize your savings. Many retailers will offer significant discounts when you buy multiple appliances. You may also save on delivery and installation fees.\n\nLook for Manufacturer Rebates\n\nManufacturers offer rebate deals throughout the year, so if you time it right, you can save hundreds or even thousands of dollars. Ask retailers about which brands are currently offering rebates. Although you may need to pay the initial cost, you can expect a nice check in the mail. You will be restricted to specific models, and you’ll need to buy within a designated time frame. But, if you time it right, there are some fantastic savings to be had.\n\nHit the Tax Time Sales\n\nTax time sales typically begin in January and run through until early spring. This is a strategy for manufacturers to get more sales at the time when many consumers get back their tax return. This is also the time when manufacturers start to release new models. So, you can get a brand new, last season model with a significant price drop. Again your timing has to be right, it may be worth trying to hold on until January to buy your replacement.\n\nSeek Out Gently Used Appliances\n\nFinally, it is worth considering buying second hand appliances. This can be a practical solution if you have a limited budget yet need to quickly replace an appliance. Many retailers offer used models for sale, and this provides the best of both worlds. You’ll enjoy a lower price tag, while having the reassurance of a reputable returns policy and store warranty.\n\nSome stores even have display models at a reduced price. So, you can get a new machine without a brand new price tag.\n\nWhile price is always a factor, it should not be your only consideration. Since you’re likely to use your appliances every day, and rely on them working properly, it is crucial that you consider the appliance efficiency, features, and capacities. There is no point in saving a few dollars on a small appliance, if you have to run it far more often.\n\nIf you’re considering upgrading your appliances, you can explore your options with our online collection, or speak to one of our home appliance experts for additional help and guidance.","publishedAt":"22 01 2021","image":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/png;base64,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","aspectRatio":1.8518518518518519,"src":"/static/66c7adf5d26370c7ab69ee4ae78bdc9b/ee604/b16499174ac17fe7fc6dc3631d2e7121.png","srcSet":"/static/66c7adf5d26370c7ab69ee4ae78bdc9b/69585/b16499174ac17fe7fc6dc3631d2e7121.png 200w,\n/static/66c7adf5d26370c7ab69ee4ae78bdc9b/497c6/b16499174ac17fe7fc6dc3631d2e7121.png 400w,\n/static/66c7adf5d26370c7ab69ee4ae78bdc9b/ee604/b16499174ac17fe7fc6dc3631d2e7121.png 800w,\n/static/66c7adf5d26370c7ab69ee4ae78bdc9b/f3583/b16499174ac17fe7fc6dc3631d2e7121.png 1200w,\n/static/66c7adf5d26370c7ab69ee4ae78bdc9b/2c576/b16499174ac17fe7fc6dc3631d2e7121.png 1285w","sizes":"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"}}}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"a-brief-guide-to-upgrading-kitchen-appliances-on-a-budget1"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1333397103","1464675814","1611424896","2496447232","2752015303","557794130"]}
