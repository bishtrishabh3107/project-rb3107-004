Not only human, almost 98% of living organisms including animals but fish or birds do also sleep and only a few come under exception like bullfrog, jellyfish or baby dolphins which do not sleep at all. \n\nLet's calculate according to new data of human life expectancy year, 90 years on an average one man can live. If 6 hours is the minimum time one human must sleep in a day for better workability or health than multiplying with 7 days in a week & then 4 weeks in a month & 12 months in a year for 90 years, we end up with the result that 25% of our life we give to sleep. \n\nHumans are bio-battery and we have to recharge ourselves with food & sleep. If we ask people around our neighbourhood that what they do to get better sleep then maximum people say they really fight with time to get good sleep. Breathing techniques, sleeping positions, environmental music and extra comfort mattresses are few comments we get through on online search and experts. Breath out more carbon-di-oxide considered to be helpful before sleep time and some people also prefer light environmental music. There are certain positions according to experts from which one can sleep better according to their health conditions while mattress also plays a good role and on which we talk later. \n\nSleeping on the stomach is the most common type, people who fit in this category mostly have neck or back pain while straining on muscles, joints are also observed. Sleeping on the left side is pretty good, not only it helps to reduce snoring, but also improve digestion and even reduce heartburn. Sleeping on the back is comfortable for body metabolism, it evenly distributes the body's weight, helps to minimize pressure and ensure a good alignment of the head, neck, and spine. Some people use to toss & turn during sleeping, and mostly this kind of habit compared with unhealthy sleeping. The effective solution which people countered with for healthy sleeping usually remains the same and that is \"Mattresses\". \n\nMattress derive from an Arabic word and was as old as a crusade. Historian comment that Arab people use to make \"Maṭraḥ\" with animal hair & skin which they carried along on travelling and later European travellers came to know with this thing which they translated \"Mattress\" to their people. It is just a pass on fact that Europeans in initials layered the fabric sheets one on another, making it thicker to sleep. Cotton was among the first natural thing which is experimented to make cheap & economical mattress by European people. There was a time when the European market gets flooded with these cotton sandwiches. Just like improvement in rocket science mattress industry also updated. With spring coil under name \"Bonnell coils\", \"Offset coils\" and \"Marshall coils mattress has been developed to a thickness around 4 inches to 8 inches. \n\nPolyurethane foam remained an evergreen material in this industry. Industrialist developed the soft polyurethane foam while trapping air inside the solid. Year on year foams was developed according to purpose. Like for aeroplane sitting rebond foam has been developed, for pillows or cushions latex rubber foam is used. These days mattress industry works with almost every type of foam out of which Memory foam and Lux foam are primarily used. Some renowned brands like Sleepwell and WakeFit make their mattress just like an automobile industry make their cars. Some listed mattresses from these brands are:\n\n- [Single Bed Foam Mattress by SLEEPX](https://amzn.to/2Mh0YtU)                        \n- [Full Bed Foam Mattress by DUROFLEX](https://amzn.to/3pLyrdL)\n- [King Size Bed Foam Mattress by WAKEFIT](https://amzn.to/2MgBvkf)\n- [Queen Size Bed Foam Mattress by DUROFLEX](https://amzn.to/3pV2AYh)","publishedAt":"23 02 2021","image":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1.5037593984962405,"src":"/static/a13833398b2cafc0f4d2f2ebf4f78931/14b42/bc50ca5ed5b393bd1ef686da81a7d58a.jpg","srcSet":"/static/a13833398b2cafc0f4d2f2ebf4f78931/f836f/bc50ca5ed5b393bd1ef686da81a7d58a.jpg 200w,\n/static/a13833398b2cafc0f4d2f2ebf4f78931/2244e/bc50ca5ed5b393bd1ef686da81a7d58a.jpg 400w,\n/static/a13833398b2cafc0f4d2f2ebf4f78931/14b42/bc50ca5ed5b393bd1ef686da81a7d58a.jpg 800w,\n/static/a13833398b2cafc0f4d2f2ebf4f78931/47498/bc50ca5ed5b393bd1ef686da81a7d58a.jpg 1200w,\n/static/a13833398b2cafc0f4d2f2ebf4f78931/ec6c5/bc50ca5ed5b393bd1ef686da81a7d58a.jpg 1280w","sizes":"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"}}}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"sleep-vs-mattress"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1527254832","1527254832","1951305561","1951305561","215063324","215063324","2312664674","2312664674","2320400669","2320400669","2496447232","2752015303","3053235663","3474663376","3474663376","494729503","494729503","557794130"]}
