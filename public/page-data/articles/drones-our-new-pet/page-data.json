Rule is simple and single, that is how to use air for flying and what symmetrical pattern should be used which benefits most. \"Drone\" which means a continuous low humming sound, first exercise at early 1920s for remotely-flown target aircrafts which were used for practice firing of a battleship's guns. Till early eighties drones were only the subject of state security and also mostly participated, governed by developed countries. As soon as the China emerged \"Worlds Factory\" many electronic things become popular and drone was one of them. From photography to air playground and delivery to defense implementations, these days drones are used in various fields in which no other machine can match them. News that delivery of \"Amazon-Product\" by drone is past and common while fishing and watering to big crop fields are the latest achievements made by human using drone. Symmetry and light weight design is core concept which helps the drone to remain stable on air and respond to desirable functions triggered by user. Manufacturers like \"DJI\", \"HUBSAN\" and \"YUNEEC\" are one of the top most in this industry and produce even customize toy drones at special orders. Single banner artists who earned through YouTube vlogs are used to cover their aerial shoots using high end drones from these legend Chinese manufacturers. Some people often asked the question \"Why four propeller quadcopters are mostly used design in toy drones\". Answer to which is very economical, quadcopters are less stable but more suitable to be made in small form factor and moreover they are mechanically simple, cheaper to make. The fastest drone in this world is \"DRL Racer X\" which has top speed of 290 Km/h while the guess part remain same it is also a quadcopter. Some International events are also organized for the drone races like \"FAI Drone Racing\" and in India itself event like \"Indian Drone Racing League\" is very well promoted by top technical colleges. In India startups are coming up since our ruling government placed many duties on Chinese products. Companies like \"1 Martian way corporation\", \"Cron Systems\" and \"Drone Tech Lab\" are some pillar in this kind of manufacturing segment which works on principle of Make In India. DRDO(Defense Research & Development Organization) has also shown the interest in drone while developing \"Swarm drone technology\" for Indian Army. One can soon say or accept the drones as our new pets because with AI technology these small helpful machine will make our life much easier. Here after viewers recommendations and by self testing, we came out with the best drones available in online market [Tello Nano by DJI](https://amzn.to/2Zi2nTL), [Star Pro by Hubsan](https://amzn.to/3aY89iY), [IZI Nano by Shift](https://amzn.to/3kpf9df) and finally [Tello Boost by DJI](https://amzn.to/2N40mrQ).
