Each package contains 8 Pcs of 2feet x 2feet tile which covers a net area of 32 Sqfeet, which means less fixing accessories or less working time needed to cover an area. \n3. Made with medium density(100 Kg/CubicMeter) polyurethane foam which enables good workability at uneven shapes, also easy to fix at any aligned surface. \n4. NRC(Noise Reduction Coefficient) of this acoustic foam is greater than .90 hence it absorbs 90% of vibration generated by impacted sound(Kindly, note that we are talking about vibration and not energy, Sound is a form of energy).\n5. STC(Sound transmission class or Sound reduction index) is also greater than 40dB, which means if we place this foam in the interior partition wall and create 100dB(too loud to hear) sound in one room then it cuts the 40dB sound from it and passes only 60dB sound to an adjacent room.","productClass":"Economical_Choice","productFamily":"Best Soundproofing Material - Tiles","link1":"https://amzn.to/3d8COg3","link2":null,"brand1":"Amazon","brand2":null,"priceRange":"4k - 5k","alt":"Silence Acoustic® Wedge Soundproofing acoustic foam 2'x2',2inches (Set of 8) (Black)","image":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1.2658227848101267,"src":"/static/b4a5a598ffdbdaf6a2f9a7818cec3d45/14b42/16dd678003325f38196787b95e27b48a.jpg","srcSet":"/static/b4a5a598ffdbdaf6a2f9a7818cec3d45/f836f/16dd678003325f38196787b95e27b48a.jpg 200w,\n/static/b4a5a598ffdbdaf6a2f9a7818cec3d45/2244e/16dd678003325f38196787b95e27b48a.jpg 400w,\n/static/b4a5a598ffdbdaf6a2f9a7818cec3d45/14b42/16dd678003325f38196787b95e27b48a.jpg 800w,\n/static/b4a5a598ffdbdaf6a2f9a7818cec3d45/9842e/16dd678003325f38196787b95e27b48a.jpg 900w","sizes":"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"}}}}},{"node":{"id":"Product_6026b1fcade999001509f85c","name":"Acoustic turbo soundproofing tile MAKE: YGM ACOUSTIC","publishedAt":"12-02-2021","description":"Grooved, light weight and high-density polyurethane material is used to completely absorb the sound energy while also provide excellent interior architectural significance.

Approved by ARAI(Automotive Research Association of India) on various aspects other than NRC & STC(as per regular ones) values.\n5.
