Type NHR is a spin-off of the company’s Flatpack series that has been proven in military and aerospace applications for nearly 30 years.\n\nThe company claims it has successfully helped customers replace large series-parallel banks of wet tantalum capacitors with fewer components, saving valuable space, weight and cost.\n\nAble to withstand operating temperatures from -55°C to 150°C, NHR aluminum electrolytic capacitors are constructed with rectangular stainless-steel cases and laser-welded covers that prevent dry-out. Components within the NHR series are available from 75Vdc through 300Vdc with capacitance values ranging from 60µF to 960µF.\n\nThere are four case lengths available in 0.5in increments from 1.5in to 3.0in. All cases measure 0.5in thin by 1.0in wide. The series has a load life of 3,000 hours at 150°C, withstands up to 50g vibration on the three largest cases and up to 80g on the smallest case size.\n\nPotential applications include any high-performance circuits that require large capacitance bulk storage and filtering at high temperature. These include power supplies and inverters for avionics, military electronics and such energy industry applications as down-hole recording devices.","productClass":"Buy_One_Buy_Once_Futuristic","productFamily":"Headphone","Link1":null,"link2":null,"image":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":0.6172839506172839,"src":"/static/cce7acdbc4b6c52e8cd69a0ec3814c9e/14b42/78d45d8685b103d28ffa8abd9d4c4142.jpg","srcSet":"/static/cce7acdbc4b6c52e8cd69a0ec3814c9e/f836f/78d45d8685b103d28ffa8abd9d4c4142.jpg 200w,\n/static/cce7acdbc4b6c52e8cd69a0ec3814c9e/2244e/78d45d8685b103d28ffa8abd9d4c4142.jpg 400w,\n/static/cce7acdbc4b6c52e8cd69a0ec3814c9e/14b42/78d45d8685b103d28ffa8abd9d4c4142.jpg 800w,\n/static/cce7acdbc4b6c52e8cd69a0ec3814c9e/47498/78d45d8685b103d28ffa8abd9d4c4142.jpg 1200w,\n/static/cce7acdbc4b6c52e8cd69a0ec3814c9e/0e329/78d45d8685b103d28ffa8abd9d4c4142.jpg 1600w,\n/static/cce7acdbc4b6c52e8cd69a0ec3814c9e/10d9a/78d45d8685b103d28ffa8abd9d4c4142.jpg 3700w","sizes":"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"}}}}}]},"strapiProduct":null},"pageContext":{"productFamily":"Headphone"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1333397103","1464675814","161018792","1611424896","2496447232","557794130"]}
