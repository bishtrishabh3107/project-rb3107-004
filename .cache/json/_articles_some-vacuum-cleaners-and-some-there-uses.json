Even, laptop & desktop computer have their first-generation parent, room-size calculating machines with nerves of vacuum tubes. Literally, today’s portable Vacuum cleaner once carried on a horse cart. In 1901, Engineer Hubert Cecil Booth was rolling his new vacuum cleaner onto the wealthier streets of London town. To conduct the miraculous cleaning, long hoses were fed through windows, the petrol-powered motor and the later electric engine were started, and the air was drawn by suction from the hose and nozzles through a filter. The basic technology and the suction principle were the same as in most vacuum cleaners today. Previously, only rich class or big house owners used to call this giant cleaning machine once a month but in 1915 small motor-powered vacuum cleaner was introduced by Hoover & Electrolux under the category of home appliance. This revolutionary vacuum cleaner consists of the suction pump for the low-pressure air caused by the air going into the cleaner, draws up small objects which then get trapped in bags, canisters, or filters.\nCurrently, there are 7 types of vacuum cleaners available in the electronic market produced by more than 100 brands. Like an iron, television, and refrigerator the vacuum cleaners are also accepted as necessary items in developed countries but also increasing the consumption footprint in developing countries too. Advantages like reduction in the use of water for cleaning and comfortable factor of old people make it record selling item among home appliance division. Unreachable areas like Fans and exhaust vents, indoor plants, and computer keyboards, all can be easily cleaned using this machine. Here are some vacuum cleaners with their specific uses for indoor cleaning.\n\nThe Canister Vacuum cleaner works best on hand surfaces or smaller, carpeted areas. They have a separate unit for the motor and receptacle for easy maneuverability, flexibility, and versatility, which makes these vacuum cleaners best for furniture and multi-surface use like Cars or stairs.\n\nDeep cleaves or Carpet Vacuum cleaners spray the carpet with soapy water, then use vacuum technology to brush the fibers and suck up the water, dirt, and stains from the carpeting. These are not designed for everyday use and are not meant for hardwood floors.\n\nUpright Vacuum cleaners are ideal for large, carpeted areas of the house. They come with both types of design, bagless or with a bag to capture dust and debris. These vacuum cleaners tend to be best for hardwood floors and carpets.   \n\nHandheld vacuums have portable and cordless designs that make them ideal for cleaning small areas. Uneven areas or vertical areas where cleaning can only manage by hand, these handheld vacuum cleaners are the only help. These are perfect for barber shops or cupboards or kitchens.\n\nA sweeper or stick vacuum is the middle ground between an upright and a handheld vacuum. These are commonly used for quick cleanup areas, such as kitchen and bathroom floors.\n\nPet Vacuum cleaners are designed to collect pet hair and minimize pet odors in the home. Pet-friendly vacuums also commonly include upholstery cleaners to help collect pet hairs on furniture.\n\nRobotic vacuums represent the latest in vacuum technology.
