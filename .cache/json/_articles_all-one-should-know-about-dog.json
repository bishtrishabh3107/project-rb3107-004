Puppies who have not had significant training require several weeks just to start establishing basic communications with them. Dogs are highly intelligent, social creatures who require mental and physical stimulation every day. Moderate-to high-energy dogs need considerable exercises, such as a long run or an extended game of fetch. Prepare to spend 20 minutes to 1 hour a day of training and exercise at least 5 days a week for the first 6 months to a year.\nIt doesn’t take that long to teach the fundamentals, however extra time to training brings spectacular results. The irony about teaching dogs is that the faster somebody tries to get results, the slower progress will be. People often underestimate the costs of taking care of a dog. At first, there are the basic supplies, ranging from a collar and leash to a crate and food, a veterinarian checkup, and possibly neutering or spaying. \n\nAdditional annual expenses such as food, vet visits and medications, toys, and supplies are also accountable.\nPuppies are extremely curious and often love to chew everything in sight. Adult dog doesn’t play bite as much, and housetraining is a little less difficult simply because their bladders are more developed and they can ‘hold it’ longer. Older dogs typically cost less to acquire too. Also, keep in mind that some of the best dogs in the world are those who have spent years in rescue shelters waiting for the perfect home. Large dogs require more room to exercise and smaller dogs tend to have longer life spans. In fact, a study published that for every 4.4-pound increase in weight, life expectancy dropped by one month. For instance, a Chihuahua can live 18 years, whereas a Mountain Dog’s life expectancy is a mere 6-9 years.\n\nA small breed might eat about a half cup of Pedigree daily, a large one can go through 10 times that. Some other basic facts also need consideration like Smaller dogs are more portable, larger dogs can ward off strangers but small dogs are easier to control. People often fixate on a particular breed, but mixed breeds are the friendliest, smartest, and most capable dogs. Experts argue that mixed breeds are healthier because of hybrid vigor, pooling from a larger range of traits, so the dog will less likely carry one of the genetic conditions common in certain breeds.\nSome might say that male dogs are more affectionate, while female dogs are more independent. Others say males are goofy and playful, while females are easier to train. Dogs thrive on a consistent schedule. Plus, keeping a routine is a crucial element to housetraining because it helps to know when the dog will likely have to go out. That starts with feeding the dog at around the same times every day and removing the bowl between meals. Dogs typically will have to go potty about 15-20 minutes after eating. Don’t leave dogs completely unattended with full run of the house until they’re around two, because they can get into a lot of trouble. Dogs cannot absorb new concepts until they burn off their excess energy.\n\nDogs learn best after exercise, so engage in vigorous activity such as fetch, before start training. ‘Yes,’ and ‘No’ are the backbone of initial training. ‘Yes’, to tell dog that owner like something it did. ‘No’ should simply mean nope and not anger or frustration. \n\n","publishedAt":"10 04 2021","image":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1.8518518518518519,"src":"/static/a4ab08917b9a811de6707a51fbc19d39/14b42/3b1de3f34a4ccb7426766a5519859001.jpg","srcSet":"/static/a4ab08917b9a811de6707a51fbc19d39/f836f/3b1de3f34a4ccb7426766a5519859001.jpg 200w,\n/static/a4ab08917b9a811de6707a51fbc19d39/2244e/3b1de3f34a4ccb7426766a5519859001.jpg 400w,\n/static/a4ab08917b9a811de6707a51fbc19d39/14b42/3b1de3f34a4ccb7426766a5519859001.jpg 800w,\n/static/a4ab08917b9a811de6707a51fbc19d39/47498/3b1de3f34a4ccb7426766a5519859001.jpg 1200w,\n/static/a4ab08917b9a811de6707a51fbc19d39/b99f1/3b1de3f34a4ccb7426766a5519859001.jpg 1345w","sizes":"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"}}}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"all-one-should-know-about-dog"}}
